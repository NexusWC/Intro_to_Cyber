This project focuses on network mapping, encompassing the identification and display of key network details such as IP and MAC addresses of devices, router specifics, and ISP information. It also involves distinguishing connection types, i.e., Ethernet or Wireless, for each device. A crucial part of the project is to demonstrate the commands or resources leveraged to gather this data. Visual representation of the network configuration, achieved via tools like draw.io, adds a valuable dimension to this comprehensive exercise.
